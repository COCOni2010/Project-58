      <p>My favourite cartoon character is Mega Charizard X from the anime 'Pokemon'. Let me tell you something more about it; Charizard is a dual-type Dragon-Fire Pok√©mon introduced in Generation I.
It is the mega evolution of Charizard which evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander. It is vulnerable to Dragon, Ground and Rock moves. Charizard's strongest moveset is Blue Flare and Blast Burn and it has a Max CP of 3,850.
Mega Charizard X flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it iss blue and melts anything that come in its way. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent not worth its fight.<br>
